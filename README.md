## üîç Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **design, verification, and FPGA implementation** of a **memory controller** that interfaces with a **parameterized single-port RAM**. The controller efficiently manages **read and write operations** using decoded addressing and handshake control signals, operating at a **100 MHz clock frequency**.

---

## üéØ Objective

To design a **reliable, modular, and parameterizable memory controller** that:
- Supports 2D RAM access via row and column.
- Decodes a flat memory address into separate row/column.
- Manages read and write operations through control logic.
- Generates status signals (`ready`, `valid`) for safe synchronization.
- Is synthesizable and deployable on FPGA hardware.

---

## üí° Key Concepts

| Concept                | Explanation |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Single-Port RAM**    | A memory that supports one access per clock (either read or write). |
| **Parameterized Design** | Makes the design scalable ‚Äî any size of memory (rows √ó columns √ó bit-width). |
| **Address Decoding**   | Converts a flat address into row and column values for 2D memory. |
| **Control Logic**      | Ensures data is read/written only when conditions are correct (using request, ready, and valid signals). |
| **Handshake Protocol** | Ensures safe communication between memory and external systems using `valid` and `ready`. |
| **Synchronous Operation** | All logic responds to a common clock signal ‚Äî ensuring predictable behavior. |

---

## üß† System Architecture

### 1. üßæ Single-Port RAM

- Acts as a **2D array** of memory elements.
- Stores data in cells addressed by row and column.
- Performs either a **read** or a **write** in one clock cycle (not both).
- Controlled using signals:
  - **req**: request to access memory
  - **rw**: read (1) or write (0)
  - **Qi**: input data
  - **Qa**: output data

---

### 2. üïπ Memory Controller

- Accepts a **flat address** (like 4 bits for 16 locations).
- **Decodes** it into:
  - **Row (ar)**: higher-order bits
  - **Column (ac)**: lower-order bits
- Controls:
  - When memory is **ready** for next operation
  - Whether the access is **read** or **write**
- Also monitors the **valid signal** from the RAM to confirm successful reads.

---

### 3. üß© Top-Level Integration

- **Connects** the controller and datapath.
- External interface receives:
  - Clock, Reset
  - Address, Data input, Read/Write request
- Internally connects controller outputs to RAM inputs.
- Exposes final outputs: **data out**, **valid**, and **ready**.

---

### 4. üß™ Testbench Logic

- Simulates realistic scenarios:
  - **Write** data to specific address.
  - **Read** from the same address and check if data matches.
- Helps verify:
  - Address decoding correctness.
  - Read/Write timing behavior.
  - Handshake signals (`ready`, `valid`).
- All actions happen in sync with clock cycles and reset behavior.

---

## üö¶ Control Flow (How It Works)

### üîÅ Write Operation
1. External system asserts **req = 1** and **rw = 0**
2. Controller decodes address ‚Üí row + column
3. RAM writes **Qi** to specified memory cell
4. `valid` stays low; write is assumed complete in 1 cycle
5. Controller asserts `ready = 1` for next operation

### üîÑ Read Operation
1. External system asserts **req = 1** and **rw = 1**
2. Address is decoded ‚Üí access cell
3. RAM outputs data at `Qa` and sets **valid = 1**
4. Controller sets `ready = 1` after confirming read
5. Data is available on the next cycle

---

## üíª FPGA Implementation (Theory)

- Deployed on **Nexys 4 DDR FPGA board**
- Used physical switches for:
  - Control signals: `rw`, `req`, `cs`
  - Data input: `Qi`
  - Address input: `addr`
- Observed outputs:
  - LEDs display data from memory (`Qa`)
  - Indicator LED for `valid`
- Implementation steps:
  1. Assign FPGA pins in `.xdc` file
  2. Synthesize and implement design
  3. Program FPGA and test in real-time

| **Power Consumption**  | Very low dynamic power due to small logic footprint. |
| **Resource Utilization** | Only a fraction of LUTs and FFs used ‚Äî efficient and minimal. |
